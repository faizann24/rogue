# Rogue üéØ
> An intelligent web vulnerability scanner agent powered by Large Language Models

Rogue is an advanced AI security testing agent that leverages Large Language Models to intelligently discover and validate web application vulnerabilities. Unlike traditional scanners that follow predefined patterns, Rogue thinks like a human penetration tester - analyzing application behavior, generating sophisticated test cases, and validating findings through autonomous decision making.

Note: This is a very early release with many planned improvements and features still in development. Open source contributions are most welcome.

### Security Testing Configuration
| Option | Description | Default | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `-p, --num-plans` | Number of security test plans per page | `10` | `-p 15` (specific count)<br>`-p -1` (unlimited) |
| `-i, --max-iterations` | Maximum iterations per security plan | `10` | `-i 5` (quick scan)<br>`-i 20` (thorough) |
| `-m, --model` | LLM model for analysis | `o4-mini` | `-m o3-mini`<br>`-m o1-preview` |

### Scope and Discovery
| Option | Description | Default | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `-e, --expand` | Test discovered URLs recursively | `False` | `-e` (enable expansion) |
| `-s, --subdomains` | Enumerate and test subdomains | `False` | `-s` (enable subdomain discovery) |

### Output and Reporting
| Option | Description | Default | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `-o, --output` | Directory for scan results | `security_results` | `-o my_scan_results` |

## üìã Usage Examples

### Quick Security Assessment
```bash
# Fast scan with 5 focused plans, 3 iterations each
python run.py -u https://target.com -p 5 -i 3
```

### Comprehensive Security Audit
```bash
# Unlimited plans with contextual CVE intelligence, thorough testing
python run.py -u https://target.com -p -1 -i 10 -e -s
```

### Targeted Vulnerability Research
```bash
# Deep analysis with maximum iterations and scope expansion
python run.py -u https://target.com -p 20 -i 15 -e -m o1-preview
```

### Subdomain Security Assessment
```bash
# Discover and test all subdomains with moderate depth
python run.py -u https://target.com -s -p 10 -i 7
```

### Custom Output Directory
```bash
# Organize results by target and date
python run.py -u https://target.com -o "results/target_$(date +%Y%m%d)" -p -1
```

## üéØ Security Testing Modes

### Plan Generation Strategies

**Limited Plans (`-p <number>`)**
- Generates a specific number of focused security test plans
- Best for: Quick assessments, time-constrained testing
- Example: `-p 5` generates 5 targeted vulnerability tests

**Unlimited Plans (`-p -1`)**
- Generates comprehensive security test coverage (15-25+ plans)
- Includes contextual CVE intelligence based on detected technologies
- Best for: Thorough security audits, research, bug bounty hunting
- Example: `-p -1` generates maximum coverage plans

### Iteration Control

**Quick Scan (`-i 3-5`)**
- Fast vulnerability discovery
- Surface-level testing
- Good for initial reconnaissance

**Standard Scan (`-i 8-12`)**
- Balanced depth and speed
- Recommended for most use cases
- Thorough validation of findings

**Deep Scan (`-i 15-20`)**
- Exhaustive testing per vulnerability
- Maximum exploitation attempts
- Best for critical applications

### Model Selection

**o4-mini (Default)**
- Fast and cost-effective
- Good for standard web application testing
- Balanced performance and accuracy

**o3-mini**
- Enhanced reasoning capabilities
- Better for complex applications
- Improved payload generation

**o1-preview**
- Advanced analytical capabilities
- Best for sophisticated targets
- Maximum accuracy and depth

## üß† Advanced Features

### Contextual Intelligence
- **Technology Detection**: Automatically identifies frameworks, CMS, libraries
- **CVE Integration**: Fetches relevant vulnerabilities from CISA KEV catalog
- **Smart Targeting**: Focuses tests on detected technologies

### Iterative Planning
- **Memory Management**: Maintains context across test iterations
- **Adaptive Strategy**: Learns from previous attempts
- **Failure Recovery**: Continues testing when exploits fail

### Traffic Analysis
- **Request Monitoring**: Captures all HTTP/HTTPS traffic
- **Response Analysis**: Analyzes server responses for vulnerabilities
- **Session Tracking**: Maintains authentication state

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Rogue is built with a modular architecture consisting of several key components:

- **Agent**: Orchestrates the scanning process and manages other components
- **Planner**: Generates intelligent testing strategies using LLMs
- **Scanner**: Handles web page interaction and data collection
- **Proxy**: Monitors and captures network traffic
- **Reporter**: Analyzes findings and generates detailed reports
- **Tools**: Collection of testing and exploitation tools

## üìä Example Report

Reports are generated in both text and markdown formats, containing:

- Executive summary
- Detailed findings with severity ratings
- Technical details and reproduction steps
- Evidence and impact analysis
- Remediation recommendations

## üîí Security Considerations

- Always obtain proper authorization before testing
- Use responsibly and ethically
- Follow security testing best practices
- Be mindful of potential impact on target systems
