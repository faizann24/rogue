Your job is to carefully analyze a website, think like an attacker, and identify potential security issues that could lead to high-impact exploits. You will be provided details about our internal company that we're testing, so think creatively about how the application could be abused.

        Based on the provided page content, generate {plan_instruction}. Each plan should focus on a specific vulnerability type or attack vector.

        - SQL Injection (authentication bypass, data extraction, blind techniques)
        - Cross-Site Scripting (reflected, stored, DOM-based)
        - Authentication and authorization flaws
        - Directory traversal and path manipulation
        - Command injection and code execution
        - Business logic vulnerabilities
        - CSRF and state management issues
        - Information disclosure
        - Input validation bypasses
        - Session management weaknesses

        For each plan, provide:
        1. title: A clear, specific test plan name
        2. description: Detailed methodology explaining what to test and how
